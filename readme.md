# Intro
>Hey everyone, welcome to post work! Congrats on making it through the course and starting in the exciting career of software development. I'm so happy for all of you and look forward to hearing about your future adventures. I know the months after graduation are very chaotic and full of lots of job prep and interviews. What I've provided in this repo are resources, assignments, and (eventually) ideas to provide guidance in the months after the class has ended. Pretty much all of these assignments could be followed up with a blog post explaining what you've learned to someone else. I strongly encourage making that a habit as well, not just blogging, but sharing what you are learning with others. __Also__ If you come across any really good resouces that have helped you that are not shown here, please submit a pull request. I hope these help you and I wish you all the best. Goodbye for now.

## 1 to 3 Months
The goal of the first few months after graduation is to keep your skills sharp while you are looking for a job. That is why a lot of these assignments are things we have done in class. You are not tredding new ground, but are diving deeper and improving on your current skills. In addition to the assignments listed below, you should be completing one kata on CodeWars or 1 assignment from exercism.io, or one project euler problem, or one challenge on hacker rank **every day**. This habit of continual practice will be inavluable as you persue your career as a software developer. *Focus* and finding your pattern is going to be so very important in the next few months. Start a code and coffee with your classmates, work on your group project with your existing partners. Start to add more features and improve the test coverage of the agency project app. Code every day. Keep Learning. Keep Practicing. Keep Growing.



### Assignments
  - Be able to write FizzBuzz on Paper (or Whiteboard) forward and backward.
  - Complete [JS Koans](https://github.com/hackages/es6.koans) Start to Finish.
  - Complete [Javascript Language Path](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/javascript)
  - Write Tic Tac Toe with tests and OO Practices.
  - Write (a.k.a blog) about the importance of OO, SOLID, and Testing to good code bases. (A series of posts on these would work best)

### Resources
  - Watch [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
  - Watch [Magic Tricks of Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M)
  - Read [Rules for Developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)

## 3 to 6 Months
By this point you should be getting ready to come to the demo day of the cohort that has come after you and you can impart words wof wisdom to them. The goal of these tasks and resources are to keep giving you someplace to go when you want to learn more. Resources to help your continued growth and to push you into new areas

### React Assignments
  - Write a react-redux app that contains zero additional packages. Perhaps clone a project we did towards the end of class. Build that functionality out with straight js functions. How would you replace underscore, moment, or react-stars if you had to write it yourself?
  - Write your own library! Its great practice and super easy with npm.

  - Complete [SQL Teaching](https://www.sqlteaching.com/) Again.
  - Complete [SQL Course 1 & 2 on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/database)
